This project is based on MERN ( MongoDb , Express, React , NodeJs ) stack.

<h1> MERN description</h1>
<h3>M = MongoDB</h3> (I have used Mongoose to make it easier for Node.js to work with MongoDB used MongoDB Atlas = MongoDB database).
<h3>E = Express</h3> (makes it easier to work with Node.js. I have use cors middleware to access other servers outside our server).
<h3>R = React</h3> (for the frontend. I have used Material UI for styling, react-router-dom for React routes, and axios to connect to the backend).
<h3>N = Node.js</h3> (for the server. I have used dotenv to load environment variables from an .env file into process.env, and nodemon to make the app auto-restart when you edit/save files).<br>
